##### NYU Department of Economics
##### NYU Center for Data Science
<b> This repo contains the code for data cleaning and final results.</b>

Preprocessing Summary (with ABBYY Finereader): 

    Solved the problem in the Note 1 and 2. The digitalization process should be:

    Before process image:
        The image must be rotate manully.
    After import:        
        1. Photo Correction
        2. Crop
        3. Correct Perspective

    After this process, we could generate excel file free from most format error.
 
Table extraction and Data Summary (with code provided): 

    The 3 ipynb files (1935,1940,1948) with years contain the code to process the Finereader-processed files. 
    The ipynb (data cleaning) fix the non-numerical values.
